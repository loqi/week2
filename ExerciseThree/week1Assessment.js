// Declaring variables
//   Use some of these variables later on for our objects and arrays.
// Defining arrays
//   Define an empty array called bestZooEver
// Defining objects
//   Define an empty object called adventureList
// Adding values to existing arrays
//   Fill bestZooEver with the names of at least 3 animals that make you squeal with delight
// Do this using at least two different ways of adding items to an array
// Adding properties to existing objects
//   Add three key-value pairs to adventureList.
//   Use the keys 'adventureOne', 'adventureDos', and 'adventureInAnAlternateUniverse'
//   Give them each a value of your own choosing.

//Functions
// Define a function called addUnicorn.
//   It takes a single string and returns a string composed of that string with 'unicorn' appended to the end.
// Let this code call your function. Verify that it works somehow.
addUnicorn('babyDinosaur'); // returns 'babyDinosaurUnicorn'

// Loops
//   Loop through each item in the bestZooEver array, and invoke addUnicorn against it
// Object access
//   Briefly describe in a comment when to use dot notation
//   Briefly describe in a comment when to use bracket notation
//   Briefly describe when you'd use quotes in your bracket notation.
// Array access
//   Write a simple expression that resolves to any one of the animal names in bestZooEver
